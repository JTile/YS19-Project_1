        "After reading some of the tweets and playing around with the filter options, we can find some valuable insights. One good first step would be removing all links since we have no way of understanding their content and eliminating all mentions to other accounts, i.e., anything that starts with the symbol @. Also, since we are doing sentimental analysis, removing stopwords should help minimize some of the tweets without losing any useful information. Emojis might be something else worth removing, although they may prove helpful in understanding the class of some tweets, so that might be worth examining. And finally, hashtags seem to be a pretty robust feature for determining the label of a tweet. A tweet with #VaccinateYourKids, #damnantivaxxers, #VaccinesWork, or #VaccineAccess is almost definitely a pro-vax tweet. On the other hand, #NoVaccineNeeded or #VAXTRUTH hashtags push us towards an anti-vax tweet, so something to keep in mind as well."

        "Adding ngrams significantly raises the training accuracy but also the validation score. Ngrams make sense since considering the context of a word can substantially change its meaning, especially in our case, since tweets may quote other tweets sarcastically or disagree.  While both anti-vax and pro-vax groups will use the same words in a different context while 'debating'. Moreover, using ngrams increases the complexity of the model, as we have more features, making the model more vulnerable to overfitting. However, since the validation score keeps rising, I believe it's worth the risk up to a point, of course. So we have decided on a model. Below is the last cell where all the pipeline has been rewritten from start to finish."
